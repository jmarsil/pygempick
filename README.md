# pyGemPick: Open Source Gold Particle Picker for Immunogold Diagnostics

## Official Python Based Automatic Immunogold Detector of the [Chakrab Lab](http://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/chakrabartty.html)

### This is the official installation guide for the PyGemPick module 

PyGemPick is the cummulation of [Joseph Marsilla's](https://github.com/jmarsil) research project 
under Dr. Avi Chakrabartty. This module contains functions that enable 
filtering, detection, and modeling of immunogold particles on TEM micrographs. 

The main project goal was to greate an open source batch gold particle picking
module built in python that could detect gold particles regardless of the amount
of counterstaining present in the IGEM (Immunogold Electron Microscopy) micrograph. 

#### pyGemPick has three main dependencies that are needed before usage

	1. [OpenCV (cv2)](https://opencv.org/) 
	2. [Pandas (pd)](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
	3. [Numpy  (np)](http://www.numpy.org/) 

I would suggest installing a new anaconda environment using [anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html)
terminal into which you can import all the required modules for your project. Having trouble installing OpenCv, use the solution 
outlined here: [(install using conda)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23119413/how-do-i-install-python-opencv-through-conda).
Pandas and Numpy can also be installed through any terminal using _**pip install pandas, numpy**_

The project will be updated in the upcoming weeks with tutorials on how to use the functions given within [pygempick](https://pypi.org/project/pygempick/). This module was built to help researchers that are building therasnotic solutions (therapy based as well as diagnostic innovations) to help pateints with rare protein misfolding diseases like ATTR amyloidosis , [Alzheimer's Disease (AD)](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp), [Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)](https://www.theaftd.org/what-is-ftd/disease-overview/) and [Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease)](https://www.als.ca/about-als/what-is-als/) using novel Immunogold diagnostic techniques. 

_**NEW:**_ This update contains supplementary 11 supplementary 
documents that will help you use the module. We cover image compression, 
image picking with singular and duplicate filtering, statistical analysis,
separation & efficiency tests to test the algorithm's useability. 

**Sample Image Data will be provided and shall be located in the DATA folder**

## Installation 
	
	pip install pygempick

    > import pygempick.core as py
    > import pygempick.modeling as mod
    > import pygempick.spatialstats as spa

#### Note numpy, pandas and opencv modules dependencies are needed prior installation. 

**NEW:** This update contains supplementary 11 supplementary 
documents that will help you use the module. We cover image compression, 
image picking with singular and duplicate filtering, statistical analysis,
separation & efficiency tests to test the algorithm's fairness.

    micrograph image and compresses it such that 1px = aproximately one nanometer. 
    the exact pixle dimentions for a 3.1x compression are given below.
    

* __*py.back_eq(image)*__

    * Takes odd and even scaling # parameters 18+ 
    * input image is regular py.compress image output,

    the starting [threshold position](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/threshold/threshold.html).
    * Takes odd scaling parameter p, input image is a py.compress output image
    
    _**Note:**_ TEM migrograph filtering using simple binary thresholding was first
    completed in 2003 with one of the first gold particle picking algorithms [GoldFinder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104784770200624X).

   * Allows you to scandetected keypoints and eliminate duplicates! Allows you 
    to detect partciles with more than one filter. Returns updated keypoints
    1 with the removed keypoints and number of duplicate(s) detected.

## Function to Optimize OpenCv's Simple Blob Detector:

* _**py.pick(image, minAREA, minCIRC, minCONV, minINER, minTHRESH)**_
    
    * Input image is a binary image from one of the above filters, next have to set
    the parameters to optimize [OpenCv's Simple Blob Detector](https://www.learnopencv.com/blob-detection-using-opencv-python-c/)
    * Detects immunogold particles on filtered binary image by optimizing picking
      across 4 main paramaters using OpenCv's simple blob detector.
    * Have to optimize picking for each set separately on a per class or per trial basis. 
    
    #### Gold Particle Picking Parameters
    
        1. minArea = lowest area in pixels of a detected gold particle (20 px**2)
        2. minCirc = lowest circularity value of a detected gold particle [.78 is square]
        3. minConv = lowest convextivity parameter which is  Convexity is defined as the (Area of the gold particle / Area of itâ€™s convex hull)
        4. minINER = minimum inertial ratio (filters gold particles based on  eliptical properties, 1 is a complete circle)

## Function to take snapshots of aggregated amyloid morphologies:

* _**py.snapshots(folder, keypoints, gray_img, i)**_
    
    * folder = folder location where snapshots will be saved, keypoints = the detected
    keypoints from py.pick function , gray_img = compressed grayscale image, i = image number.
    
    * Takes an compressed grayscale image and uses the detected keypoints as a marker
    to take a snapshot of within a 100px radius of that gold particle's position.
    *Researchers use this to analyze the morphological properties of protein aggregates*
     

## Function to Draw Immunogold-like test images using OpenCv:

* _**mod.draw(n, test_number, noise, images)**_

        according to mu1, sig1. 
    3. images are the number of images in the set - used with n which is number of 
       particles detected in the actual set to calulate the particle density of model 
       set.
 
 ## Function to Classify TEM micrographs based on average gray pixel intensities:

* _**mod.imgclass(inv_img)**_
    
    * Uses a compressed grayscale image from [cv2.cvt_color(RGB2GRAY)](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/miscellaneous_transformations.html)

    faster particle detection since we aren't running the same filtering step more 
    than once! 
    
    * Completes separation test for _**dual high-contrase filter comparrison**_.

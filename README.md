# pygempick
#### Open Source Batch Gold Particle Picking &amp; Procesing for Immunogold Diagnostics

PyGemPick is the cummulation of Joseph Marsilla's research project 
under Dr. Avi Chakrabartty. This module contains functions that enable 
filtering, detection, and modeling of immunogold particles on TEM micrographs. 

The main project goal was to greate an open source batch gold particle picking
module built in python that could detect gold particles regardless of the amount
of counterstaining present in the IGEM (Immunogold Electron Microscopy) micrograph. 

This module has three main dependencies that are needed before usage: 

	1. OpenCV (cv2) for image processing. 
	2. pandas (pd) for Data analysis 
	3. numpy  (np) 


The project will be updated in the upcoming weeks with tutorials on how 
to use the functions given within pygempick. This module was built to
help researchers diagnose pateints with rare protein misfolding diseases 
like ATTR, AD, FTD and ALS using novel Immunogold diagnostic techniques.

## Installation 
	
	pip install pygempick

#### Note numpy, pandas and opencv modules dependencies are needed prior installation. 

*STAY TUNED FOR UP COMING USAGE TUTORIALS*
